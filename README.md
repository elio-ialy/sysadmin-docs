# SysAdmin Documentation Portfolio

## Overview
Hello, my name is Elio. I am an aspiring IT Support and System Administration professional with a strong interest in cybersecurity.

This repository serves as my **personal sysadmin documentation portfolio**, where I document what I learn, build, and practice in system administration, networking, and security. The goal is to produce **clear, reproducible, and security-aware documentation** following professional standards.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Document system administration tasks and labs
- Practice professional technical writing
- Build a public portfolio for academic and professional growth
- Apply security best practices in documentation
- Ensure reproducibility of configurations and procedures

All documentation is written with the mindset that **another administrator should be able to reproduce the work without additional explanation**.

---

## Scope
This repository focuses on:
- Linux system administration
- Basic networking concepts
- Security hardening and best practices
- Runbooks and operational procedures
- Architecture and system overviews

⚠️ No real credentials, secrets, or production-specific data are included.
